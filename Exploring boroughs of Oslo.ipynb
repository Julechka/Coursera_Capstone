Searching for a suitable place to live is not easy. Not only price and quality of housing is taken into account, but also neighbourhood. Very popular and wide-used resources such as finn.no make it easy to search for housing based on many different parameters, such as area, price, year of building, energy use and borough. It's possible to use the address and then google maps for looking into the surroundings.\n\nHowever, it's not enough for solving the problem of searching for the neighbourhood, which suits the personal requirements. For example, I would personally considering moving to Olso due to job situation. Many of my colleagues have the same problems when looking for a place to live. The project is aiming to help solve this challenge.\n## Methodology and Data\nFor solving the problem it will be necessary to use several data sources. Data wrangling will include pre-processing, dealing with missing values and data formatting. It's planned to use following data sources:\n1.\tWikipedia for making the list of the boroughs\n2.\tGeocoder for searching their coordinates and\n3.\tFoursquare location data for finding the venues and their ratings.\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) will be used to analyze data in order to summarize main characteristics of the data, gain better understanding of the data set, uncover relationships between different variables, and extract important variables for the problem we're trying to solve. Working Dataframe planned to be created using Python and several Data Analysis Libraries. Visualization of data will be done using the Folium and maps with markers. k-Means Clustering will be used for predicting categorical classed labels.\n\nThen the results will be analyzed and conclusion made.\n"
